# QuoteMachine  
Completed this project as part of the [FreeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine)     

Topics learned:
* Asynchronous calls with ```$.ajax()```
* Working with 3rd party APIs (Twitter and [QuotesOnDesign.com](https://quotesondesign.com))
* JQuery animations/timing

## Updates
* Updated to reflect new tweet limit of 280 characters

## Usage
It's as easy as clicking a button!   
You can Tweet out the quote, but if it's too long the machine will kindly inform you.
